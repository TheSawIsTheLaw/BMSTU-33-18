By a cliff a golden cloud once lingered! On his breast it slept, but, riseing early,!Off it gently !!rushed across the pearly!Blue of sky, a tiny thing and winged.!Still, atrace it left upon the stony!!!!Giant's heart, and plu!!111nged in thought and weepingSlow and tortured tears, he stands there, keepingVigil o'er the gloomy waste and lonely.!
