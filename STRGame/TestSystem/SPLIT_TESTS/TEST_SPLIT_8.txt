Children run into their izba, Hail their father, drip with sweat: "Daddy, Daddy! Come - there is a Deadman caught inside our net." "Scary, scary fabrication," Grumbled back the weary Pa, "Oh these imps' imagination... Deadman, really: ya-ha-ha! Hmm... the court may come to bother; What'll I say before the judge?.. Hey you brats, go have your mother Bring my coat; I'd better trudge... So, where is he?" - "There, Dad, farther!" On the sand where dragnet ropes Lay spread out, the children's fatherSaw a veritable corpse. Badly mangled, ugly, frightening, Blue and swollen on each side - Has he fished in storm and lightningOr committed suicide? Could this be a careless drunkard Or a mermaid-seeking monk Or a trusting merchant, conquered By some bandits, robbed and sunk? To the peasant, what's it matter? Quick: he grabs the dead man's hair, Drags the body to the water, Looks around: nobody there: Good; relieved of the concern he Grabbed a paddle, gave a toss, And the stiff resumed his journey Downstream for a grave and cross. Long the dead man as one livingRolled on waves amid the foam. Having watched his gradual leaving, Our glum peasant started home. "Come you pups! let's go, don't scatter. Each of you will get his bun. But remember: just you chatter - And I'll whip you, every one."
