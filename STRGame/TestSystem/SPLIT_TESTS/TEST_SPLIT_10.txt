Storm-clouds hurtle, storm-clouds hover; Flying snow is set alight By the moon whose form they cover; Blurred the heavens, blurred the night. On and on our coach advances, Little bell goes din-din-din... Round are vast, unknown expanses; Terror, terror is within. - Faster, coachman! "Can't, sir, sorry: Horses, sir, are nearly dead.

"There, look, there he's playing, jolly! Huffing, puffing in my course; There, you see, into the gully Pushing the hysteric horse; Now in front of me his figure Looms up as a queer mile-mark - Coming closer, growing bigger, Sparking, melting in the dark." Storm-clouds hurtle, storm-clouds hover; Flying snow is set alight By the moon whose form they cover; Blurred the heavens, blurred the night. We can't whirl so any longer! Suddenly, the bell has ceased, Horses halted... - Hey, what's wrong there? "Who can tell! - a stump? a beast?.."
