On hills of Georgia lies the covering of night; Aragva streams in front of me. Such sadness and such ease; my melancholy's light, My melancholy's full of thee, Of thee, of only thee... No anxiousness, no pain Unsettles my despondency; My heart again on fire, it burns and loves again, For otherwise it cannot be.
