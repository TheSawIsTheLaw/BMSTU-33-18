     !!!,      revelry's voice, are you still? Ring out, songs of Bacchus, our patron! Long life to you, maiden and matron, Ye fair ones who gave of your love with a will! Drink, friend, drink with gusto and relish! As I do in mine, In your glass of wine       Fling lightly the ring that you cherish! Come, let's clink our glasses and high let us raise them! Hail, muses! Hail, reason! In song let us praise them!     Thou, bright sun of genius, shine on!      Like this ancient lamp that grows dimmer      And fades with the coming of dawn, So false wisdom pales at the first flash and glimmer     Of true wisdom's ne'er-fading light... Live, radiant day! Perish, darkness and night!
