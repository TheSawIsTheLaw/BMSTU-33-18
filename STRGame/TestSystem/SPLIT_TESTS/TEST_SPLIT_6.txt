Through the murk the moon is veering, Ghost-accompanist of night, On the melancholy clearingsPouring melancholy light. Runs the troika with its dreary Toneless jangling sleigh-bell on Over dismal snow' I'm weary, Hungry, frozen to the bone. Coachman in a homely fashion's Singing as we flash along; Now a snatch of mournful passion, Now a foulmouthed drinking-song. Not a light shines, not a lonely Dusky cabin... Snow and hush... Streaming past the troika only Mileposts, striped and motley, rush. Dismal, dreary... But returning Homewards! And tomorrow, through Pleasant crackles of the burning Pine-logs, I shall gaze at you: Dream, and go on gazing, Nina, One whole circle of the clock; Midnight will not come between us, When we gently turn the lock On our callers... Drowsing maybe, Coachman's faded, lost the tune; Toneless, dreary, goes the sleigh-bell; Nina, clouds blot out the moon.
