I like you well, O trusty dagger mine, My comrade wrought of cool Damascus steel!Forged were you by the Georgian with revenge in the mind,By the Circassian free - for war were you made keen.A lily-white hand it was gave you to me -You were affection's keepsake, its last gift...Not blood, but pearl-like tears born of the agonyOf bitter parting down your blade ran swift.Her dark eyes rested, full of secret pain,Of sadness and of mystery, uponMy face, and like yourself when lit by flickering flame,Now clouded and turned dull, now glowed and shone.O dagger, love's mute pledge, you will my trueFriend stay, and an example set to me, a wanderer:For faithful, yes, and firm of soul like youI'll be like you that tempered was by fire.
