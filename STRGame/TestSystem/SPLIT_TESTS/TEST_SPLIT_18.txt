The Bard is killed! The honor's striver. Fell, slandered by a gossip's dread,. With lead in breast and vengeful fire,.Drooped with his ever-proud head..The Poet's soul did not bear.The shameful hurts of low breed,.He fought against the worldly "faire,".Alone as always,... and is killed!.He's killed! What for are late orations.Of useless.praise; and weeps and moans,.And gibberish of explanations? -.he fate had brought her verdict on!.Had not you first so hard maltreated.His free and brave poetic.gift,.And, for your pleasure, fanned and fitted.The fire that in ashes drifts?...You may be happy... Those tortures.Had broken his strength, at last:.Like light, had failed the genius gorgeous;.The sumptuous wreath had weathered fast.
