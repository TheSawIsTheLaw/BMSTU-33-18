-Listen, if stars are lit it means - there is someone who needs it. It means - someone wants them to be, that someone deems those specks of spit magnificent. And overwrought, in the swirls of afternoon dust, he bursts in on God, afraid he might be already late. In tears, he kisses God's sinewy hand and begs him to guarantee that there will definitely be a star. He swears he won't be able to stand that starless ordeal. Later, He wanders around, worried, but outwardly calm. And to everyone else, he says:'Now, it's all right. You are no longer afraid, are you?' Listen, if stars are lit, it means - there is someone who needs it. It means it is essential that every evening at least one star should ascend over the crest of the building.-
