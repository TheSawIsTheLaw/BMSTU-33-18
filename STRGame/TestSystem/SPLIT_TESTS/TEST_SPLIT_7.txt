I have endured my desire, I've ceased to love my fairy dreams, And only fruit of hearty fire - My sufferings have stayed, it seems. And under storms of cruel kismet My blooming spirit quickly died, I waited for the end, I missed it. I'm feeling loneliness inside. So that enveloped by the blow Of cold wind and stormy flaws A leaf which is belated, sole, Vibrates on bare branch in pause..
